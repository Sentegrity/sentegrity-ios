/** Good Dynamics Authentication Token request.
 * The Good Dynamics Authentication Token mechanism enables
 * applications to utilize the user identification that takes place during Good
 * Dynamics authorization processing. This allows the user to be authenticated
 * without the need for entry of any additional credentials at the device.
 * 
 * See below for an overall description of the Good Dynamics Authentication
 * Token mechanism. This class includes the specific API for requesting
 * tokens.
 * 
 * @see  \reflink GDiOS::authorize: authorize (GDiOS)\endlink for more details of Good Dynamics authorization
 * processing.
 * @see \ref ServerAPIGDAuthToken
 * 
 * <h3>Good Dynamics Authentication Token Mechanism</h3>
 * The Good Dynamics (GD) platform includes rigorous authentication of the end
 * user. This is used when, for example, identifying whether the user is
 * entitled to run the current application, and when applying security policies.
 * 
 * The Good Dynamics Authentication Token (GD Auth) mechanism enables
 * applications to take advantage of the authentication processes of the GD
 * platform.
 *
 * GD Auth tokens can be requested by the GD application on the device. A token
 * will only be issued if authorization processing has completed, and the end
 * user's identity has been authenticated.
 *
 * Once a token has been issued, the application on the device can send the
 * token to the application server at the back end. The GD Auth token can then
 * be checked by the application server, using a verification service provided
 * by the GD infrastructure.
 *
 * The sequence of APIs used in GD Auth is as follows:
 * -# The mobile application calls \reflink GDUtility::getGDAuthToken: getGDAuthToken\endlink to
 *    request a token.
 * -# All being well, a token is issued and the
 *     \reflink GDAuthTokenDelegate::onGDAuthTokenSuccess: onGDAuthTokenSuccess\endlink callback is
 *    invoked and passed the new token.
 * -# The mobile application sends the token, and the user ID of the end user,
 *    to its application server, using an HTTP request, socket, or some other
 *    method.
 * -# The application server checks that the token is valid by calling the
 *    verification service in the \ref ServerAPIGDAuthToken, hosted by an
 *    enterprise Good Proxy server.
 * -# The response from the verification service includes the user ID of the end
 *    user, if the token is valid. The application server can check that the
 *    value from the verification service is the same as that originally sent by
 *    the mobile application.
 * .
 * This sequence validates the end user's identity, and the application server
 * can therefore grant access to resources and other permissions.
 *
 * The same token could be sent again later, and verified again. Calling the
 * verification service does not cause the token to be consumed.
 *
 * Note that the mobile application can obtain the user ID of the end user from
 * the <tt>GDAppConfigKeyUserId</tt> value in the collection returned by the
 * \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS)\endlink function.
 * 
 * <h3>Challenge Strings</h3>
 * A <em>challenge string </em>can be passed as a parameter to the GD Auth token
 * request by the mobile application. The same challenge string will then be
 * provided to the application server, in the response from the verification
 * service.
 *
 * The challenge string could have a number of uses for application developers.
 * A typical usage could be to tie an instance of authentication to a previous
 * access request, as follows:
 * -# The mobile application attempts to access a resource on the application
 *    server.
 * -# The application server generates a random challenge string.
 * -# The application server responds to the mobile application with a denial of
 *    access message that includes the random challenge string.
 * -# The mobile application requests a new GD Auth token, and passes the value
 *    from the denial of access message as the challenge string.
 * -# The mobile application again attempts to access the resource on the
 *    application server, but this time includes the GD Auth token in the
 *    request.
 * -# The application server sends the token to the verification service, which
 *    responds with a challenge string.
 * -# The application server checks that the challenge string from the
 *    verification service is the same as the random challenge string initially
 *    sent to the mobile application in the denial of access message.
 * .
 * In the above, a new random challenge string is generated on every resource
 * access attempt. This has the effect of making the GD Auth tokens one-use. A
 * more advanced algorithm might be to store the token and challenge string in
 * the App Server as a session identifier. To end a session, the App Server
 * could delete the stored token and challenge string, effectively forcing the
 * mobile application to generate a new token, based on a new challenge string,
 * when it next connected.
 * 
 * The verification service provides the challenge string to the application
 * server in an HTTP header, which limits the character set that can be utilized
 * safely. All letters and numerals that lie in the ASCII range 32 to 126 can be
 * utilized safely. Use of other characters is not supported.
