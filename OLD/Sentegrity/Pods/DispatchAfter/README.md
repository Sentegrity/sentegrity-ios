DispatchAfter
=========

DispatchAfter is a simple and modern way to make delayed calls with ability to cancel them.
It written in Swift and can be used in both Swift and Objective-C projects.

Notes:
* works on any thread but dispatches only to main
* no need to make strong ref to SFDispatchObject while waiting for dispatch
