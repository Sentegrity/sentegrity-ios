/**
 *  A UIViewController subclass that allows you to easily ask for the
 *  permission status regarding a permission category. You should not instantiate
 *  ISHPermissionRequestViewController objects directly.
 *  Instead, you instantiate subclasses of the ISHPermissionRequestViewController class.
 *
 *  Instances of this class are expected to be used in concert with ISHPermissionsViewController
 *  and to be returned from the ISHPermissionsViewControllerDataSource method:
 *
 *  @code
 *  - (ISHPermissionRequestViewController *)permissionsViewController:(ISHPermissionsViewController *)vc requestViewControllerForCategory:(ISHPermissionCategory)category {
 *       return [YourPermissionRequestViewController new];
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Usually no further configuration is required on your part.
 *
 *  Your subclass can create a view with text, images, and buttons etc. explaining in greater
 *  detail why your app needs a certain permission. The subclass should contain buttons (or other
 *  controls) that trigger at least one of the actions listed below. A cancel button should call 
 *  changePermissionStateToAskAgainFromSender:. When overwriting one of the three actions,
 *  you must call super.
